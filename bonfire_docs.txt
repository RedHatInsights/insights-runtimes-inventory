You may need to log in, by using this page (uses Github to authenticate):

https://oauth-openshift.apps.c-rh-c-eph.8p0c.p1.openshiftapps.com/oauth/token/request

This will give you an oc login command. Run it in your venv.

Enter the following command to deploy the advisor backend and frontend components along with their dependencies (notice the use of the --frontends=true argument):

# You may need to set up DNS routing for a few domains to go via the VPN:
$ sudo systemd-resolve -i tun0 --set-domain=redhat.com --set-domain=~amazonaws.com --set-domain=~devshift.net --set-domain=openshiftapps.com

# This command requires you to be on the VPN (you may also deploy "advisor" for a fuller set of components)
$ NAMESPACE=$(bonfire deploy host-inventory --frontends=true)
Optional: Extend your Ephemeral Environment for the time it might take you to complete this exercise. You can start with a two hour extension and update later if you need to.

$ bonfire namespace extend $NAMESPACE --duration 2h
Enter the following command to print access info for your namespace

$ bonfire namespace describe $NAMESPACE
You’ll use the URL and login credentials listed in the command output to view your inventory, advisor and rbac apps in the web UI.

In your web browser, enter the hostname and log in with the username/password that you retrieved in the previous step.

In your web browser, click All Apps and Services > Inventory. Note that your inventory listing is empty. It’s time to add something to it.

Return to your terminal window and use the following command to generate a Basic auth header:

TEMP_INSIGHTS_TOKEN=$(oc get secret env-$NAMESPACE-keycloak -n $NAMESPACE -o json | jq '.data | map_values(@base64d)' | jq -r -j '"\(.defaultUsername):\(.defaultPassword)" | @base64')
To upload a new item to your host inventory, enter the following command:

curl -F "file=@/path/to/file/security_low.tar.gz;type=application/vnd.redhat.advisor.somefile+tgz" \
 -H "Authorization: Basic $BASIC_AUTH" \
 -H "x-rh-request_id: testtesttest" https://<my-hostname>/api/ingress/v1/upload -v --insecure
The output of the command will indicate success or failure.
